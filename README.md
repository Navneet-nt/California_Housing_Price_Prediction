## Introduction

This project utilizes the [California Housing Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) from Kaggle. It consists of 8 numerical features such as `longitude`, `latitude`, `housing_median_age`, and one categorical feature `ocean_proximity`. The target variable is `median_house_value`.

The goal is to build a model that predicts the house prices based on these features using various machine learning algorithms.

## Installation & Requirements
